# üìÑ Netfly Peppol REST API ‚Äì Documentation v2.1

Welcome to the Netfly Peppol REST API documentation. This API is designed to allow secure and efficient exchange of business documents (such as invoices) with the Peppol network. In addition to sending and receiving documents, it also allows clients to manage their own list of Peppol participants through a RESTful interface.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîê Token-based authentication via Auth0 (OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials)
- üì§ Send UBL-based XML documents into the Peppol network
- üì• Retrieve incoming Peppol documents assigned to your organization
- üìÉ Get a list of all sent and received documents
- üë• Manage your own Peppol participants (create, update, delete, list)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The API is built on modern Jakarta EE standards and is protected with Auth0 JWT tokens. All endpoints accept and return data in JSON or XML format, depending on the operation. The system is designed to interoperate with ERP systems via REST calls, making integration flexible and secure.

## üßæ Version

- API Version: 2.1
- Last Update: 12 April 2025

## üß∞ Requirements

- Auth0 Client ID and Secret (provided by Netfly)
- Proper Peppol-compliant XML document format (UBL 2.1 or equivalent)
- HTTPS connectivity to the Netfly API host

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Each request to the API must be authenticated using a valid JWT token obtained from the Auth0 token endpoint. See Authentication section for details.


---
# üåç API Environments: Test & Production

The Netfly Peppol REST API is available in two distinct environments:

- ‚úÖ TEST Mode ‚Äî for development, integration, and validation purposes.
- üöÄ PRODUCTION Mode ‚Äî for live usage in production workflows.

Each environment has its own base URL, authentication domain, and credentials. Users will receive separate Client ID and Client Secret values for each mode.

## üîê Authentication Settings

When authenticating with Auth0, you must use the correct audience and token URL depending on the environment.

| Environment | Auth0 Domain                  | Audience URL                                             |
|-------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| TEST        | https://netfly-test.eu.auth0.com | https://netfly-test.eu.auth0.com/api/v2/                |
| PRODUCTION  | https://netfly-go.eu.auth0.com  | https://netfly-go.eu.auth0.com/api/v2/                  |

> üß† Note: The audience must match exactly. Incorrect values will result in authentication failure.

## üåê REST API Base URLs

All endpoints are prefixed by a base URL that depends on the selected environment.

| Environment | API Base URL                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| TEST        | https://peppol2.netfly.be              |
| PRODUCTION  | https://service.netfly.eu.com          |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only use the Production environment once your integration has been approved by Netfly and is ready for live operations.

## üìã Credentials Management

You will receive two sets of credentials:

- One Client ID and Client Secret for the TEST environment
- A separate Client ID and Client Secret for the PRODUCTION environment

Never mix credentials or use TEST credentials in production or vice versa.

## üß™ Best Practices

- Test thoroughly in the TEST environment before switching to PRODUCTION.
- Validate all participant identifiers, payload formats, and headers.
- Ensure your server uses HTTPS for all requests.

# üîê Authentication via Auth0

Before accessing any Netfly Peppol API endpoints, you must authenticate via Auth0 using the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow.
This will provide you with a JWT (JSON Web Token) that must be included in the Authorization header of your API requests.

## ‚úÖ Sample Authentication Request (curl)

Here is an example of how to retrieve your access token using curl:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://netfly-test.eu.auth0.com/oauth/token \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "audience": "https://netfly-test.eu.auth0.com/api/v2/",
    "grant_type": "client_credentials"
  }'
```

Replace:

- YOUR_CLIENT_ID with the actual Client ID assigned to your application
- YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET with your corresponding secret

> üîê Note: Ensure you are using the correct audience and Auth0 domain that matches your environment (TEST or PRODUCTION). See [API Environments](#üåç-api-environments-test--production) for reference.

## üì• Sample JSON Response

If the request is successful, Auth0 will return a JSON response like the following:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...Abc123XYZ",
  "scope": "read:actions update:actions delete:actions create:actions",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

Only the access_token is required for calling the API.

## üîÑ Token Expiration

- The token is valid for 24 hours (86400 seconds).
- When it expires, you must request a new token using the same authentication request.

## üìé Usage in API Calls

Once you have the token, include it in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests like this:

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...Abc123XYZ
```

This ensures that your client is authenticated and authorized to interact with Netfly‚Äôs API endpoints.


---
# üì§ Send Business Document to Peppol Network

This endpoint allows an authenticated client to send a business document (e.g., Invoice or Credit Note) to the Peppol network.
The document must be conformant with the Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 standard and encoded in XML.
Authentication is required via a Bearer token issued by the Netfly Auth0 server.

### üåê Endpoint
`POST /netfly/sendDocument`

### Headers
- `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `Content-Type: application/xml`

### Request Body
Binary XML file (UBL Invoice or Credit Note conformant with Peppol BIS Billing 3.0).

### üß™ cURL Example
```bash
curl -X POST https://peppol2.netfly.be/netfly/sendDocument \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/xml" \
  --data-binary @path/to/invoice.xml
```

### ‚úÖ Successful Response
```json
